If you have linked us, please kindly change your links to the new URL! The new layout is designed by Trinity again, featuring the silouettes of Himeno and Hayate.

Thank you for everyone's patience and enjoy the new location!<br><br><br>
<b>Feb. 18th of 2004:</b> New (temporary) version of <b>Project: Shirayuki</b> here, because that last one lasted too long. :P Designed by Trinity again, this layout features screenshots from the anime. Unfortunately, Marurori had a computer crash just as her skaiiNET server crashed. Therefore, the <b>Tanaka</b> shrine will not be back for a little while. The <b>Hayate</b> and <b>Takako</b> shrine were semi-saved, but are not up yet. Please bare with us as we get the files backed up.<br><br><br>
<b>Jun. 02nd of 2003:</b> The <a href="http://pretear.org/sasame" target="_blank">Sasame</a> shrine, the <a href="http://pretear.org/himeno" target="_blank">Himeno</a> shrine and the <a href="http://pretear.org/mannen" target="_blank">Mannen</a> shrine all have brand new manga images up! The Sasame shrine has also been revamped. ^_^<br><br><br><b>Apr. 20th of 2003:</b> And we're back 2 days later, bringing you Marurori's <a href="http://pretear.org/natsue" target="_blank">Natsue</a> shrine! Please check it out! :)<br><br><br><b>Apr. 18th of 2003:</b> Wow, we haven't updated in quite a while huh? :P At any rate, the Tyipi shrine is up, made by <b>Europa</b>! It's absolutely adorable, so please visit by clicking the Tyipi section on Project: Shirayuki! :)<br><br><br><b>Jan. 05th of 2003:</b> The Tanaka shrine is up, made by <b>Marurori</b>!
