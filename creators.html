The shrines were chosen between us simply by picking which character we wanted to do and arrange it from there. So, if you want to know more about the creators behind Project: Shirayuki (Proj. S), here's the place.

<br><br>» <b>Trinity</b><br>Trinity - oldest of the three, claiming a little corner on the webworld with <a href="http://ainoyume.net" target="_blank">AinoyumeNET</a>. Always hungry and easily amused, she spends much of her free time being lazy, doing something artistically-related or computer-related. All of Proj. S's main designs were her creations. Other than Pretear, she harbors a strong liking for Ouran Koukou Host Club, Gravitation, Tokyo Babylon, X/1999, Rurouni Kenshin and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. She claims ownership to the Sasame, Himeno and Mannen shrine on Proj. S and also manages Proj. S's small subpages such as this one.

<br><br>» <b>Marurori</b><br>Marurori, co-creator of Proj. S, manages the Hayate and Natsue shrine that are currently featured. In her spare time, she enjoys acting and singing, as well as drawing and webdesign. Other obsessions of hers includes Kare Kano, Ai Yori Aoshi, CCS, and other various anime series. She also brought up the idea of this collective.

<br><br>» <b>Europa</b><br>Europa, third member to join the Proj. S and the mastermind behind <a href="http://www.cleverheart.net" target="_blank">Cleverheart.net</a>. The massive general site (Tulip Style) and the Tyipi shrine (Ageru!), were her creations, but have sadly closed over the years due to loss of interest.
